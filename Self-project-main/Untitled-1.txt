Error : cannot reach API SERVER

Fix: 
Step 1 — Run Backend Correctly

From backend folder:

uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload

⚠️ MUST use 0.0.0.0
If you use 127.0.0.1, phone cannot access it.

✅ Step 2 — Find Correct IP

Run:

ipconfig

Look under the network you are actually using.

From your previous output:

WiFi IPv4: 10.7.27.42

That means your API URL must be:

const API_URL = "http://10.7.27.42:8001";

NOT:

127.0.0.1

localhost

192.168.100.xxx (wrong network)

✅ Step 3 — Test From Phone Browser

Before opening app:

On phone browser type:

http://10.7.27.42:8001/docs

If this does NOT open → network/firewall problem.

If it opens → frontend config problem.


the issue was in api.ts the const api url was 10.27.... soemthing , i changed it to 192.168.100.253 .....
